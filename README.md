Determines semantic similarity between two questions on Quora, enhancing applications in information retrieval using Scikit-Learn

● Implemented an End-to-End NLP model with 79% accuracy, that determines semantic similarity between two
questions on Quora, enhancing applications in information retrieval using Scikit-Learn.
● Enhanced model accuracy from an initial 73% utilizing the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
technique to an impressive 79% by incorporating a blend of foundational features, like common words, question’s
length ratio, and advanced features, leveraging functions from the fuzzy-wuzzy library.
